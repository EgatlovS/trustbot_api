# trustbot_api
#### Introduction
Trustbot_API is an easy to use Framework to write bots for the Twitch-Chat, which relies on the IRC-Protocol.  
See also: [RFC-2812](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812)  
I also implemented a Client-Framework, which is applicable of all methods provided by the [Twitch-REST-API](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API).
#### Yet another Twitch-Chat API
>**What leads me to write a new Java-API for a Twitch-Chat-Bot?**  
>A friend of mine, who started streaming, wanted to write his own ChatBot and asked for some help.  
>Every API I saw was simply not readable or just processed the Bot in a synchronous approach.
>I need to confess I didn't search a lot...! So I started to write an API for that by myself.
